# Release notes

Changes to habits people already have. The app has no "what's new" panel, so they're noted here.

## Drawing precision (2026-10)

Two habits change:

- **Esc saves a label instead of cancelling it.** In a node's label editor Esc used to throw the edit away; now
  it keeps it, as it already did for text and notes, and as Figma and tldraw do. Every text box on the canvas
  works the same way: Enter or Esc saves, Tab goes to the next field (label, then subtitle). Changed your mind?
  Ctrl+Z (⌘Z on a Mac) right after takes the edit back.
- **Snap to grid is now Snapping, and the arrow keys stay on the grid.** Dragged nodes line up with their
  neighbours' edges and centres, and with equal gaps, as well as with the grid. Hold Ctrl (⌘ on a Mac) while
  dragging to place something freely. An arrow key moves the selection to the next 10 px grid line and
  Shift+arrow moves it 50 px; they used to move 1 px and 10 px, which they still do with Snapping turned off
  (Show ▸ Snapping).

Also new:

- Enter edits the selected node, edge, boundary or annotation (F2 still works).
- Label editors stay readable when you're zoomed out.
- Ctrl+K opens at once, and what you type straight after it goes into its search.

## Drawing basics (2026-10)

Two habits change, to work like Figma, tldraw, Excalidraw and draw.io:

- **The wheel pans; Ctrl/⌘+wheel zooms.** A two-finger swipe moves the canvas in both directions, a pinch
  zooms, and Shift+wheel pans sideways on a mouse. Mouse users who zoomed with the wheel now hold Ctrl (⌘ on a
  Mac). Space+drag and the middle button pan from anywhere, even starting on a node.
- **A drag on empty canvas draws a selection box** (it picks what it touches; hold Ctrl/⌘ for only what's
  inside). Shift+click now adds to the selection, like Ctrl/⌘+click. Live view, presentation and embeds still
  pan with a drag, and an embed still lets the wheel scroll its page.

Also new:

- Drop a connection on empty canvas to pick the next node: it lands there, connected, ready to name.
- A connection dropped anywhere on a node connects to it; the node lights up first, and handles are easy to
  hit at any zoom.
- Ctrl+D, Ctrl+V and Alt+drag never put a copy on top of anything. Ctrl+V pastes at the pointer.
- Shift+2 zooms to the selection (also in Ctrl+K).
